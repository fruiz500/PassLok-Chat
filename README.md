PassLok Chat
===============

PassLok Chat implements WebRTC chat in conjunction with PassLok privacy. It does not run on its own, but needs to run within an iframe in PassLok. The reason why this part of the code is on a separate GitHub repository is that Phonegap is being used to make releases not containing the chat code, out of the main PassLok repo.


PassLok Chat is based on RTC Multi Connection, by Muaz Khan: <https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/RTCMultiConnection>

Full documentation is included with PassLok docs at: <http://passlok.weebly.com/> including a user manual, a technical design document, and a number of articles and video tutorials.
